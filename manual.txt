Description of how to run the programs:
Random tree:
  example:
    $ python3 randomTree.py < inputfile > outputfile
    
Partially Persistent Linked List:
  example:
    $ python3 PPLL.py < inputfile > outputfile
  It also works without files, and you can change the e value by giving it as an argument.
  example:
    $ python3 PPLL.py 4 < inputfile > outputfile

Maketest:
  example: 
    $ python3 maketest.py test5 1000 testfile
  maketest takes 3 arguments, what kind of test, the size of the input, and the output file name
  The possible kinds of tests made for random trees are:
  "test4", "test5", "test6"
  The possible kinds of tests made for PPLL are:
  "test7", "test8", "test9"
